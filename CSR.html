					<h2>How We Help</h2>
					<p>Being a good “corporate citizen” is more than a good idea that is something nice a business should do.  A good corporate social responsibility plan for a business could be the difference between success and failure. Having a good CSR plan can you build strong preference with your customers. Consumers today are more educated, savvy and aware than ever before. At Academix Hub, we care about the environment. That is why we pride ourselves on the benefits that using our program has on the health and longevity of our natural environment. Academix Hub is an electronic resource that helps secondary students study and learn. This resource reduces and could even eliminate the need for hard copy resources such as textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. This links closely with the values of Academix Hub, as we also aim to help students make the most of their education, and achieve to the best of their ability. <br>
						As part of our giving back to the community, we plan to invest 10% of our net profits back into The Smith Family to purchase IT hardware and internet connectivity to support disadvantaged children most at need. It is out help that by providing this technology, that it will assist children in developing skills needed to obtain a successful future.</p>

					<h2>The Smith Family</h2>
					<p>Academix has decided to select The Smith Family as it will be a way for the business to give back to the community. The Smith Family is a charity that helps disadvantaged children get the most out of their education and assist in developing social, financial and life skills, so they can have a better future. The Smith Family is the largest Australian children’s education charity helping disadvantaged young Australians to succeed at school. They believe that education has the power to change young children’s lives and break the cycle of disadvantage that plagues the disadvantaged around the country. More than 1.1 million Australian children are living in poverty, The Smith Family provides targeted and continual long-term support throughout the first two decades of a child’s life. In 2017, 151,497 disadvantaged children and their families received our support, in 94 communities across the country. </p>

					<h2>What is CSR</h2>
					<p>The days of operating a business solely for profit are gone. Whilst this is obviously still a very important part, many companies now focus largely on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) which is a huge part of a successful business. CSR is an ethical framework which suggests that an organisation or individual, has a responsibility to act for the benefit of society at large, with minimal impact on the environment. In terms of business, this relates to things like honesty, disclosure of information and abiding by the various laws relating to the business. People want to feel good about what they’re paying for. It was found that approximately 91% of global consumers expect businesses to operate responsibly to address social and environmental issues. </p>
